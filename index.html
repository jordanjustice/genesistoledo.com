title: Genesis Christian Fellowship
---

<p>After much prayer & conversation we have decided to end our attempts at planting a self-sustaining church community in West Toledo. Rather than continuing to attempt to create a new church we have decided to join a very old one. As of January 19, 2014 many of the families that made up Genesis Christian Fellowship will join <a href="http://www.standrewsepiscopal.net/">St. Andrews Episcopal Church</a> in West Toledo. We are thankful for the effort and support from so many that allowed Genesis to exist this long and we now set our sights on continuing to pursue the Kingdom here on earth just as it is in heaven with our brothers & sisters at St. Andrews.</p>
